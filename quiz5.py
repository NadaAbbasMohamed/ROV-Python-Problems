# Write this code

# Write a function called "quiz5" that takes one argument of type 'str'.
# Then split the string by whitespaces into a list, and capitalize each word of it.
# Then return that list.
#
# Be aware of trailing whitespaces
#
# You should keep the function name as it is.


def quiz5(string):
  # Write the code here
  pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
  print(quiz5(input("Enter your text: ")))

# OUTPUT Example:
